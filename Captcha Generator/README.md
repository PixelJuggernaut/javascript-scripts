 Custom Captcha Generator in HTML CSS & JavaScript
 
CAPTCHA is an anti-bot security feature that combines distorted letters and numbers. It is employed to differentiate between humans and automated bots. Its purpose is to restrict access to specific online features like registration or comment posting. The distorted characters pose a challenge that bots have difficulty solving.
